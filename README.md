# Java-BST

## Ben Schwartz

This is a simple Java implementation of a binary search tree, consisting of the following files:

- `LinkedBST.java`: represents the binary search tree itself, and provides methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal of the tree
- `TreeNode.java`: represents a node in the binary search tree
- `findNode.java`: a utility class used for searching the binary search tree
- `TreeRunner.java`: a simple demo program that creates a binary search tree and prints its contents

Please note this is a high school project, and I'm not quite sure how functional this is.
